# Lesson 1

## Stating your Wants and Needs

Learning a new languge is fun. But it is more fun when you can practice it with someone. If the learner has a practice partner, great. But if the learner is just learning to spend some time in a place where their target language is spoken, that's a valid scenario too. Either way, a great place to start would be able to express that you want or need something. This could be as simple as asking for a glass of water, or telling cab driver where to go, or telling a vendor what you are looking for.

### Vocabulary

- _enakkU_, "For me".
- _unakkU_, "For you".
- _vENum_, "is wanted".
- _aamaa_, "yes".
- _aa_, closed question suffix.
- _um_, "also" suffix.

So how to say "I want X" in Tamil? It's put slightly differently. "For me, it is wanted".

> _Paari: enakkU_ icecream _vENum_.
>
> Paari: For me, icecream is wanted. (I want icecream.)

To make a closed question, where the answer can be yes or no, just add _aa_ to the verb _veeNum_.

> _Paari: unakkU_ icecream _vENum-aa_ ?
>
> Paari: You want icecream?
>
> _Kabilan: aama. enakkU_ icecream _vENum_.
>
> Kabilan: Yes. For me, icecream is wanted.

If you need to say you _!too!_ need something, just add _um_ after _!for me!_ or _!for you!_. If the word ends with a _U_, like _enakkU_ or _unakkU_ it loses the final _U_.

> _Paari: unakkU vENum-aa_ ?
>
> Paari: You want (it)?
>
> _Kabilan: aama, vENum. uNakkU ?_
>
> Kabilan: Yes, (for me, it) is wanted. For you?
>
> _Paari: enakk'-um vENum_.
>
> Paari: For me too, it is wanted.

From above example you could see that in spoken Tamil, a lot of details can be dropped if the context is available.  

The "also" particle can also be put with the subject, and just not with the verb. But it means a different thing. The emphasis is put on _!you!_ rather than the _!it!_.

> _Kabilan: unakkU vENum-aa_ ?
>
> Kabilan: You want (it)?
>
> _Paari: aama, vENum_.
>
> Paari: Yes, (for me, it) is wanted.
>
> _Kabilan: unakk'-um-aa vENum_ ?
>
> Kabilan: For you also, (it) is wanted? (you want it too? I thought you didn't want it.)

You might have noticed how the suffixes chain in the _unakkumaa_ above. In fact, _unakkU_ or _vENum_ are all already in such chained forms that are introduced this way here to not complicate things. We will break this chain to understand the parts that make it.

## Asking Someone to do Something

### Vocabulary

- _paNNU_, "do", verb.
- _ezudU_, "write", verb.
- _pO_, "go", verb.
- _-ngaL_, honorofic suffix.

To order someone to do something is easy with the verb _paNNU_ if you know very less Tamil. It is essentially the same word as "do" in English. You can attach an English verb before it, and magically it will convey what you need to someone to do. Most people who speak Tamil can understand basic English. So you can expect someone to know what "drive" or "explain", the same cannot be expected of "extrapolate" or "estimate" from all speakers. This would work only if the other person has English literacy. So it is a good place to start, but do not depend on this. Also, you are here to learn Tamil. So as you learn more vocabulary, shedding this "English" support should be easy.

> To ask someone to drive, say "drive _paNNU_".

_paNNU_ can also be used with nouns, to mean "making something".

> To ask someone to make a cake for you, say "_enakkU_ cake _paNNU".

This is fine if you are talking to a 6 years old. It is expected that honorofic ending is used with the verbs if you are talking to strangers and elders. Missing will be perceived as being rude. If it is obvious that you do not know to speak Tamil, this would mostly not be a problem, as people generally understand your situation. But you do now, so let us try again. You just have to add _-nga_ to the verb.

You might have noticed that it is listed as _-ngaL_ and not not _-nga_ above. And there is a good reason for it. We will come back to this ubiquitous suffix again.

> To ask politely someone to drive, say "drive _paNNUnga_".

The same works for other Tamil verbs as well. Just using the dictionary form will be a command by itself! No extra work needed.

> _pO !_
 Go!
>
> _pOnga !_
 Please go!
>
> _ezudU !_
 Write !
>
> _ezudUnga !_
 Please ezudUnga

Of course, you can ask someone to do something for you.

> _enakkU paNNUnga_.
> Please do (this) for me.

## Can you do this?

### Vocabulary

- _ennaala_, "By me".
- _unnaala_, "By you".
- _muDiyum_, "is doable/finishable".

Instead of asking someone to do something, in many cases you would want to ask if they _!can!_ do something.

> _unnaala muDiyumaa?_
>
> By you, (it) is doable? (Can you do it?)
>
> _muDiyum_.
>
> (It) is doable. (I can do it.)

But do what? You would think you can insert in English words here. That doesn't work here. You can do it in a round about way, and it is very common, by using the `infinitive` form of _paNNU_. If this term scares you, think of it as a form of verb that cannot exist on its own, but has to come with another. In English, this is done by adding -ing to a verb. You swim. You do swimming. Here the infinitve of swimming is used with the verb do.

#### Forming infinitive

For a verb ending in _U_, drop that, and add _a_. You got it. 

> _paNNU_ "do!" > _paNN-a_ infinitive of "do".
>
> _ezudU_ "write!" > _ezud-a_ infinitive of "write".

Verbs can end in other vowels, we will look into them later. They are formed differently. But one exception can be stated here to make things easier.

> Infinitive of _pO_ "go!" is _pOga_ or _pOva_.

Now these infinitives can go before the word _muDiyum_ to say "to be able to do X".

> _unnaala paNNa muDiyumaa?_
>
> By you, is doing (it) doable? (Can you do it?)
>
> _unnaala_ drive _paNNa muDiyumaa?_
>
> By you, is driving doable? (Can you drive?)
>
> _ennaala_ Tamil _ezuda muDiyum._
>
> By me, writing Tamil is doable. (I can write Tamil)
>
> _unnaala_ Chennai _pOga muDiyumaa?_
>
> By you, going (to) Chennai is doable? (Can you go to Chennai?)

Some of you might have noticed that the words for both "for me" and "by me", start with _en_. And this is not a coincidence. They are formed by attaching _kU_ and _aala_ to _en_. And the same is done to _un_ as well for "you". They respectively are the suffixes for "for" and "by".

> _enakkU_ < _en-(ak)-kU_
>
> _unnaala_ < _un-(n)-aala_

Knowing this isn't really necessary. But this encourages us to use this pattern further for any noun including names, instead of just "you" and "me".

> John-_(U)-kU_ icecream vENumaa ?
>
> For John, icecream is wanted? (Does John want icecream?)
>
> Claire-_aala_ car drive _paNNa muDiyum_.
>
> By Claire, car driving is doable. (Claire can drive cars.)

_aala_ can also come as _naala_ sometimes. But it means the same. 

> Claire-_naala_ car drive _paNNa muDiyum_.
>
> By Claire, car driving is doable. (Claire can drive cars.)

If the "u" in John-_(U)-kU_ confuses you, there is no rule that says it has to be done. It can just be John-_kU_. Spoken Tamil often likes its words to end in vowel and not in a consonant. It is removed if a suffix starting with a vowel is added to it. Does formation of infinitives make more sense now?
